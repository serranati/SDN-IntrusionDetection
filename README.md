# SDN-IntrusionDetection
This project implements a simple Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Software-Defined Networking (SDN).  
The goal is to let an **ONOS controller** extract flow information from the network, send it to an external **REST API**, and receive a classification such as *benign* or *malicious*.  
The REST API will integrate a trained ML model for detecting attacks such as DDoS.

## Running the REST API Server

The IDS REST API is implemented using **FastAPI**.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn rest_api.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
   ```

3. The API will be available at:

   ```
   POST http://localhost:5000/predict
   ```

4. Interactive API documentation (auto-generated by FastAPI) is available at:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/docs
   ```

ONOS will send flow statistics to this endpoint for classification.
